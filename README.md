# Matrix Multiplication Benchmark: CPU vs GPU 🚀

This project compares the performance of **CPU vs GPU** for matrix multiplication using **NumPy** and **CuPy**. It measures execution time and visualizes speedups as matrix sizes increase.

## 📌 Features
- Matrix multiplication on CPU (NumPy) and GPU (CuPy)
- Benchmarking across different matrix sizes
- Performance visualization using Matplotlib
- CLI support for custom matrix sizes
- Unit testing with PyTest

## 📊 Performance Comparison
CPU and GPU execution times are recorded, and speedup is calculated. Here’s a sample graph:
